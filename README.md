# Talks and Presentations I've given

Below is a list of talks and presentations I've given at various ocassions, sorted by their event and somewhat chronologically.



## IDWerkstatt

I gave a short introduction on eco-friendly energy consumption and stopping unecessary economic growth at the *IDWerkstatt*, a repeating round of lightning talks held in the offices of the Pirate Party in Dresden, Germany.

Both were recorded and are available on YouTube. Unfortunately they're in German only, sorry.

## Cocoaheads

So far I've given two presentations at the Cocoaheads Meetup in Dresden. One together with [Benjamin Herzog](https://github.com/BenchR267) about Swift finally becoming open source and one about Reverse Engineering iOS Apps.

The latter one also has a textual English translation on my blog.

## Dresden Science Night

At the Dresden Science Night (or LNdW - Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften) I've held a few lightning talks over the years, an introduction to Bitcoin and an overview of the marvelous world of esoteric programming languages. Unfortunately these were also in German only.

## Mobile Camp

I've held my talk about reverse engineering iOS apps at the Mobile Camp 9, a yearly barcamp at the TU Dresden faculty of computer science before repeating the same talk at our local Cocoaheads meetup. Unfortunately there is no recording, so see the Cocoaheads version above.
